# 👋 Welcome to Klarc Clarabal’s Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I'm Klarc — a cybersecurity enthusiast and blue teamer based in Quebec, Canada 🇨🇦. I'm currently pursuing a Certificate in Applied Cybersecurity at McGill University and hold several credentials, including **CompTIA Security+**, the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, and hands-on experience with SIEM, network traffic analysis, and endpoint monitoring tools.

This GitHub serves as my collection of projects that reflect real-world cybersecurity scenarios, from SIEM configuration to threat detection, log analysis, and firewall hardening.
